This is the the T2 conference challenge from year 2006 (t206-challenge.exe) containing a VM that runs self-modifying code. Interestings things to try using this tool:<br/>
<ul>
	<li>Visualize memory access to/from the code section of the VM using the "Memory overview" tool. Example settings are given below.
		<ul>
			<li>Address: 2A48CA</li>
			<li>Byte count: 100</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Move the time slider around the very beginning of the trace and note how the values in the memory view (bottom) change. Click on a red value to draw a data flow graph of how the value was produced.</li>

</ul>
