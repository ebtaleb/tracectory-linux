This is the the T2 conference challenge from year 2006 (t206-challenge.exe) containing a VM that runs self-modifying code. Some tricks to try using this tool:<br/>
<ul>
	<li>Visualize memory access to/from the code section of the VM using the "Memory overview" tool. Example settings are given below.
		<ul>
			<li>Address: 2A48CA</li>
			<li>Byte count: 100</li>
		</ul>
	</li>

	<li>
		After you have found the decryption loop using the memory overview trick described above, select a byte written (red square) so that you land on the instruction that wrote that byte. Then go to CPU view and select "Next read". This will transfer you to the point in time when the unencrypted byte is executed by the VM.
	</li>
	<li>
		You can then use the overview tool again on this unencrypted region. Remember to adjust the time period so that the memory is actually executed during the speicifed period, though. The first decrypted VM instruction is a jump so you may need to increase the byte count.
	</li>
</ul>
